# 2023_DS_Fall_Homework 2

## Execution environment and Constraint.
* CPU core: 1
* Memory: 2 GB
* Execution time limit: 1 second
* C Compiler: GCC
    * compiled with -O3 -std=c11 -Wall
* C Standard: C11
* Use header file only from C Standard Library
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

## Problem 1: Priority Queue (3%)

Write a C function to create an empty F-heap and support the following 
instructions. Each line in the input file represents one instruction. 
1. insert x val : insert an element with key x
2. extract : print out the minimum in the heap and delete it
3. delete x val : delete the node which has key x and value val
4. decrease x val y : decrease the key by y on the node which has key x and 
value y
5. quit : terminate the program

Note that all operations must leave behind properly structured F-heaps. Your 
functions for (3) and (4) must perform cascading cuts. 

### Constraints
* ‚àí2147483648 ‚â§ ùë•, val ‚â§ 2147483647
* 1 ‚â§ ùë¶ ‚â§ 2147483647
* 2 ‚â§ ùëõ ‚â§ 105, ùëõ is number of instructions
* The key after decreasing will not exceed the boundary of 32-bit signed integer.

## Problem 2: Efficient Binary Search Tree (10%)

Program the search, insert, and delete operations for red-black trees. 
1. search x : Print out the color of the tree node if the element x exists. If the 
element x does not exist, print out Not found\n. 
2. insert x : Add an integer x to the red-black tree. If x already exists, do nothing. 
3. delete x : Delete the element x if the element x exists. 
(Note: The textbook did not describe how to implement delete on red-black tree. 
Students can write your own delete to satisfy the constraint of the red-black 
tree.) 

The instructions are insert, search, delete and quit. Instruction quit means you should terminate your program. 

## Get Started
Please make sure that `git, gcc & make` has been installed successfully.

Run

```bash
$ make
```
to compile the src files.

You can now enter the output directory and check out the outputs.
